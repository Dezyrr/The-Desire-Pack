Here I present to you the desire pack (desire s&d)

notable changes / additions:
- custom camo colors
- secondary camo colors
- instashoots for self or team
- instasprint for self or team
- insta shotgun pump for self or team
- always zoomload for self or team
- always knife lunge for self or team
- miniscule health
- no fall damage
- prevent enemy forfeit
- tp bot to you
- cod4 ak
- golden deagle
- custom titles and emblems (not many)
- fixed sweeping uav not applying after rounds

there aren't that many custom titles or emblems simply because I couldn't be bothered to do loads, I will definitely make some more when I can be bothered but for now enjoy what's been done

the only emblem there I think is an animated spinning pentagram which replaces the spinning prestige 10 logo

anyway have fun and let me know if anything crashes or if there's bugs, there hasn't been heavy testing or anything
