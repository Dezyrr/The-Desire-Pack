# ***THE DESIRE PACK***

feel free to make pull requests if you want this shit updated, idgaf

Don't mind the dogshit code and bad practice, this was my first time working with the Xbox environment, might be my last. 
The experience wasn't that bad, I lost motivation a lot during the making of this because I came out of my comfort zone, not knowing anything about the cod engine. 
90% of the code is pasted and or taken from already existing closed-source "packs".

I'm taking my white british ass back to PC development on my beloved source engine üíîüôè #LongLiveHvH

* Colin (I ask for directions / help and he basically gatekept everything other than image injection)
* Matrix (I stole shit from shake :steamhappy:)
* IDA (for allowing me to skid from Shake, TonyPack \& Isotope)



Enjoy looking through this absolute shit heap code and I wouldn't even advise you try and use this for anything useful, forcehost is tied together by tape and hope.
